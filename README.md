# Arndt Compositions: Connections with Fibonacci Numbers, Statistics, and Generalizations

## Welcome!

My name is Daniel Checa.

Here you will find the code files for my thesis 'Arndt Compositions: Connections with Fibonacci Numbers, Statistics, and Generalizations,' as well as the **[document's PDF](https://nbviewer.org/github/dfcheca/Arndt-Compositions/blob/d7d3431ddc18711c419883c1c8aa91ec9b5375df/document/Checa%2C%20Daniel%20F.%20%282023%29%20-%20Arndt%20Compositions%2C%20Connections%20with%20Fibonacci%20Numbers%2C%20Statistics%20and%20Generalizations.pdf)**.

## Abstract

_Abstract taken from the text:_

Arndt compositions are those integer compositions $(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ such that $x_{2i-1} > x_{2i}$ for all $i > 0$. [Hopkins and Tangboonduangjit](https://www.fq.math.ca/Papers1/60-5/hopkins.pdf) proved that for each positive integer $n$, there are $f_n$ Arndt compositions, where $f_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number. This project aims to provide an alternative proof of this result using generating functions and analytically explore some statistics and generalizations of this combinatorial object. The studied statistics encompass the number of summands, the size of the last and the first summands, the size of the largest and smallest summands, and the number of interior lattice points and semiperimeter associated with the bar graph of each composition. The results are diverse, including an unpublished identity of Fibonacci numbers and new combinatorial interpretations of some sequences.

_Keywords:_ Arndt, Integer, Compositions, Partitions, Fibonacci, Generating functions, Statistics, Generalizations.

_This work led to some of the results shown in the article "[Arndt compositions: a generating functions approach](

## About the Code Files

I recommend using Wolfram Mathematica version 12.1 or higher to fully utilize all the described packages and symbols. If you don't have a license, all these can be replicated in the free version of Wolfram Cloud. I am a supporter of open-source software, but this program comes with specific and easy-to-use built-in functions. Perhaps in the not-too-distant future, I may consider creating analogous files in SageMath, but I make no promises.

## About the PDF

Here is the latest version of the document sent to my faculty; however, it may contain typos, which I plan to add over time. How do I plan to do this? To be honest, I find it reasonable to add this list of errors to a separate file. If I decide to modify the PDF due to a significant error or a long series of errors, I will inform appropriately and host both the original and modified versions, duly marked.

## Errors

If you find any errors or suggestions in both the code and the document, feel free to open an issue.

Without further ado, I bid farewell, and I hope you have the opportunity to read the document. Yes! I designed it for you. Warm regards from any part of the world :D
